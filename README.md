# Introduction

Servihelper is an executable app that runs on the machine _(Windows, Mac or Linux)_

The program is free.

Your data is managed internally on the local device with .json files, so it never goes to the internet.

Its purpose is for help the Jehovah's witnesses to create and manage all kind of assignments.

Also supports territory creation and distribution.

Also supports public speech assignments.

## Download links

Download app section: [Download for Windows, Mac or Linux](https://github.com/TitoMoi/servihelper/releases).

## The executable is not recognized on Mac

Thats because i dont have an Apple developer Id _(i have to pay for it)_, you need to trust the binary manually, go to:

mac -> security tab -> general tab and below the section are the instructions to allow it.
